TODO
-----------------------------------
o   Plot [x: days held, y: ticker ranking]
o   Regularly pick a random set of bars (N = ~500) and check the mean ROI
    given the standard sell signal (ROI >= m*x + b)
o   Integrate with Quantopian's zipline
    -> https://www.zipline.io
o   Add jupyter-esque capabilities to Literate
o   Find a similar line to determine how long to wait after a drop
    before buying
o   Expand to NASDAQ and ARCA

DONE
-----------------------------------
x   Make `simulate` take a range of years and combine results
x   Add config file for DB location and API keys
x   Filter buys according to ticker ranking
    -> maybe change the drop so that there are more to choose from
    -> the power is in the number of high-confidence short-return investment
       opportunities
x   mean returns / stddev of returns
    -> Sharpe ratio
    -> look at ROI/month
