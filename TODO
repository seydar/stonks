BUGS
-----------------------------------

TODO
-----------------------------------
o   Plot [x: days held, y: ticker ranking]
o   Find a similar line to determine how long to wait after a drop
    before buying
o   Expand to NASDAQ and ARCA
o   Rename all the cache files
o   Write bindings Alpaca API for v2
o   Apply already-applied splits to data < 2008
    -> for each split, download the original data and recalculate what the
       ratio is
    -> Split[3207].ratio # => 10.36
o   You buy at the next day's opening... but wouldn't you also be selling
    at the next day's opening as well? (currently you sell at that day's
    closing)

DONE
-----------------------------------
x   Make `simulate` take a range of years and combine results
x   Add config file for DB location and API keys
x   Filter buys according to ticker ranking
    -> maybe change the drop so that there are more to choose from
    -> the power is in the number of high-confidence short-return investment
       opportunities
x   mean returns / stddev of returns
    -> Sharpe ratio
    -> look at ROI/month
x   Plot the graph of all year-long time periods (not just jan 1 - jan 1,
    but jan 2 - jan 2, etc.)
x   Ensure that orders are being created for the right buy date. Since they are
    placed before the day's bar is available, they don't have anything to match
x   Add a rebalancing method to Accounts so that I can add more money and
    have some of it go to support my earlier investments (if they're still
    down). I guess it's a doubling-down function
x   Mark stocks that are no longer traded
o   Integrate with Quantopian's zipline
    -> https://www.zipline.io
    -> company went under in 2020
x   Regularly pick a random set of bars (N = ~500) and check the mean ROI
    given the standard sell signal (ROI >= m*x + b)
x   Test with stocks that have been delisted as well
x   Sometimes, script/invest will end up with a negative circulation value
    -> get a repro case
    -> has trouble with stocks that are bought in the morning and sold at night
    -> `script/invest -a RPD
